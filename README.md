# commandftp
A simple command line FTP client in python using ftplib.

This project is primarily practice but I plan on using it myself when in need of a quick ftp client. Hopefully others will find it useful as well.

1. Nothing to install, just type 'python ftpclient.py'
2. Simple linux like commands like **ls** to list directory contents, **cd** to change working directory.
3. Currently you can hard code your login info to credentials.py instead of constantly entering it in the prompt however you don't have to.

##Roadmap

There are a lot of things I can add to make this more useful and this list will probably grow.

1. Need to add a way to change local working directory.
2. Ability to "Put" a directory and all it's contents.
3. Commands need to be more 'linux like' in that the entire command is one line vs two line prompts. (Enter command> rm example.txt) vs (Enter command>rm ; Enter file name> example.txt)
4. More to come...
